Hlw everyone!

I am Apoorva Kothari from Bhilwara, Rajasthan. I'm pursuing B Tech in IT branch from IIIT Lucknow. I have done my schooling from SSE Bhilwara.
As for my interest, I like mathematical and logical thinking, watching movies/series (esp. sci-fi and action), badminton. I can cook and act well.
I would love to join every club (except art club coz I'm a atrocious artist) to improve my skills and knowledge.
Not good at coding but do my best in coming years.
